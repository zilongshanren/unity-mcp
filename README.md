## How It Works 

MCP for Unity connects your tools using two components:

1. **MCP for Unity Bridge:** A Unity package running inside the Editor. (Installed via Package Manager).
2. **MCP for Unity Server:** A Python server that runs locally, communicating between the Unity Bridge and your MCP Client. (Installed automatically by the package on first run or via Auto-Setup; manual setup is available as a fallback).

## Installation ⚙️

### Prerequisites

  * **Python:** Version 3.10 or newer. [Download Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
  * **Unity Hub & Editor:** Version 2021.3 LTS or newer. [Download Unity](https://unity.com/download)
  * **uv (Python toolchain manager):**
      ```bash
      # macOS / Linux
      curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh

      # Windows (PowerShell)
      winget install --id=astral-sh.uv  -e

      # Docs: https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/
      ```
      
  * **An MCP Client:** : [Claude Desktop](https://claude.ai/download) | [Claude Code](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code) | [Cursor](https://www.cursor.com/en/downloads) | [Visual Studio Code Copilot](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/overview) | [Windsurf](https://windsurf.com) | Others work with manual config

 *  <details> <summary><strong>[Optional] Roslyn for Advanced Script Validation</strong></summary>

        For **Strict** validation level that catches undefined namespaces, types, and methods: 

        **Method 1: NuGet for Unity (Recommended)**
        1. Install [NuGetForUnity](https://github.com/GlitchEnzo/NuGetForUnity)
        2. Go to `Window > NuGet Package Manager`
        3. Search for `Microsoft.CodeAnalysis`, select version 4.14.0, and install the package
        4. Also install package `SQLitePCLRaw.core` and `SQLitePCLRaw.bundle_e_sqlite3`.
        5. Go to `Player Settings > Scripting Define Symbols`
        6. Add `USE_ROSLYN`
        7. Restart Unity

        **Method 2: Manual DLL Installation**
        1. Download Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.CSharp.dll and dependencies from [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.CSharp/)
        2. Place DLLs in `Assets/Plugins/` folder
        3. Ensure .NET compatibility settings are correct
        4. Add `USE_ROSLYN` to Scripting Define Symbols
        5. Restart Unity

        **Note:** Without Roslyn, script validation falls back to basic structural checks. Roslyn enables full C# compiler diagnostics with precise error reporting.</details>

### 🌟 Step 1: Install the Unity Package

#### To install via Git URL

1. Open your Unity project.
2. Go to `Window > Package Manager`.
3. Click `+` -> `Add package from git URL...`.
4. Enter:
    ```
    https://github.com/zilongshanren/unity-mcp.git?path=/MCPForUnity
    ```
5. Click `Add`.

#### To install via OpenUPM

1. Install the [OpenUPM CLI](https://openupm.com/docs/getting-started-cli.html)
2. Open a terminal (PowerShell, Terminal, etc.) and navigate to your Unity project directory
3. Run `openupm add com.coplaydev.unity-mcp`

**Note:** If you installed the MCP Server before Coplay's maintenance, you will need to uninstall the old package before re-installing the new one.

### 🛠️ Step 2: Configure Your MCP Client
Connect your MCP Client (Claude, Cursor, etc.) to the Python server set up in Step 1 (auto) or via Manual Configuration (below).

**Option A: Auto-Setup (Recommended for Claude/Cursor/VSC Copilot)**

1. In Unity, go to `Window > MCP for Unity`.
2. Click `Auto-Setup`.
3. Look for a green status indicator 🟢 and "Connected ✓". *(This attempts to modify the MCP Client's config file automatically).* 

<details><summary><strong>Client-specific troubleshooting</strong></summary>

  - **VSCode**: uses `Code/User/mcp.json` with top-level `servers.unityMCP` and `"type": "stdio"`. On Windows, MCP for Unity writes an absolute `uv.exe` (prefers WinGet Links shim) to avoid PATH issues.
  - **Cursor / Windsurf** [(**help link**)](https://github.com/CoplayDev/unity-mcp/wiki/1.-Fix-Unity-MCP-and-Cursor,-VSCode-&-Windsurf): if `uv` is missing, the MCP for Unity window shows "uv Not Found" with a quick [HELP] link and a "Choose `uv` Install Location" button.
  - **Claude Code** [(**help link**)](https://github.com/CoplayDev/unity-mcp/wiki/2.-Fix-Unity-MCP-and-Claude-Code): if `claude` isn't found, the window shows "Claude Not Found" with [HELP] and a "Choose Claude Location" button. Unregister now updates the UI immediately.</details>


**Option B: Manual Configuration**

If Auto-Setup fails or you use a different client:

1. **Find your MCP Client's configuration file.** (Check client documentation).
    * *Claude Example (macOS):* `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
    * *Claude Example (Windows):* `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`
2. **Edit the file** to add/update the `mcpServers` section, using the *exact* paths from Step 1.

**Claude Code**

If you're using Claude Code, you can register the MCP server using the below commands:

**macOS:**

```bash
claude mcp add --scope user UnityMCP -- uv --directory /Users/USERNAME/Library/AppSupport/UnityMCP/UnityMcpServer/src run server.py
```

**Windows:**

```bash
claude mcp add --scope user UnityMCP -- "C:/Users/USERNAME/AppData/Local/Microsoft/WinGet/Links/uv.exe" --directory "C:/Users/USERNAME/AppData/Local/UnityMCP/UnityMcpServer/src" run server.py
```
**VSCode (all OS)**

```json
{
  "servers": {
    "unityMCP": {
      "command": "uv",
      "args": ["--directory","<ABSOLUTE_PATH_TO>/UnityMcpServer/src","run","server.py"],
      "type": "stdio"
    }
  }
}
```

On Windows, set `command` to the absolute shim, e.g. `C:\\Users\\YOU\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\WinGet\\Links\\uv.exe`.

**Windows:**

  ```json
  {
    "mcpServers": {
      "UnityMCP": {
        "command": "uv",
        "args": [
          "run",
          "--directory",
          "C:\\Users\\YOUR_USERNAME\\AppData\\Local\\UnityMCP\\UnityMcpServer\\src",
          "server.py"
        ]
      }
      // ... other servers might be here ...
    }
  }
``` 

(Remember to replace YOUR_USERNAME and use double backslashes \\)

**macOS:**

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "UnityMCP": {
      "command": "uv",
      "args": [
        "run",
        "--directory",
        "/Users/YOUR_USERNAME/Library/AppSupport/UnityMCP/UnityMcpServer/src",
        "server.py"
      ]
    }
    // ... other servers might be here ...
  }
}
```

(Replace YOUR_USERNAME. Note: AppSupport is a symlink to "Application Support" to avoid quoting issues)

**Linux:**

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "UnityMCP": {
      "command": "uv",
      "args": [
        "run",
        "--directory",
        "/home/YOUR_USERNAME/.local/share/UnityMCP/UnityMcpServer/src",
        "server.py"
      ]
    }
    // ... other servers might be here ...
  }
}
```

(Replace YOUR_USERNAME)

## Usage ▶️

1. **Open your Unity Project.** The MCP for Unity package should connect automatically. Check status via Window > MCP for Unity.
    
2. **Start your MCP Client** (Claude, Cursor, etc.). It should automatically launch the MCP for Unity Server (Python) using the configuration from Installation Step 2.
    
3. **Interact!** Unity tools should now be available in your MCP Client.

    Example Prompt: `Create a 3D player controller`, `Create a tic-tac-toe game in 3D`, `Create a cool shader and apply to a cube`.

### Working with Multiple Unity Instances

MCP for Unity supports multiple Unity Editor instances simultaneously. Each instance is isolated per MCP client session.

**To direct tool calls to a specific instance:**

1. List available instances: Ask your LLM to check the `unity_instances` resource
2. Set the active instance: Use `set_active_instance` with the instance name (e.g., `MyProject@abc123`)
3. All subsequent tools route to that instance until changed

**Example:**
```
User: "List all Unity instances"
LLM: [Shows ProjectA@abc123 and ProjectB@def456]

User: "Set active instance to ProjectA@abc123"
LLM: [Calls set_active_instance("ProjectA@abc123")]

User: "Create a red cube"
LLM: [Creates cube in ProjectA]
```

## Troubleshooting ❓

<details>  
<summary><strong>Click to view common issues and fixes...</strong></summary>  

- **Unity Bridge Not Running/Connecting:**
    - Ensure Unity Editor is open.
    - Check the status window: Window > MCP for Unity.
    - Restart Unity.
- **MCP Client Not Connecting / Server Not Starting:**
    - **Verify Server Path:** Double-check the --directory path in your MCP Client's JSON config. It must exactly match the installation location:
      - **Windows:** `%USERPROFILE%\AppData\Local\UnityMCP\UnityMcpServer\src`
      - **macOS:** `~/Library/AppSupport/UnityMCP/UnityMcpServer\src` 
      - **Linux:** `~/.local/share/UnityMCP/UnityMcpServer\src`
    - **Verify uv:** Make sure `uv` is installed and working (`uv --version`).
    - **Run Manually:** Try running the server directly from the terminal to see errors: 
      ```bash
      cd /path/to/your/UnityMCP/UnityMcpServer/src
      uv run server.py
      ```
- **Configuration Failed:**
    - Use the Manual Configuration steps. The plugin may lack permissions to write to the MCP client's config file.
